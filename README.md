# WFRP4e - FX

A module for the [Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/wfrp4e) system for Foundrt VTT. This module adds some FX to the game (see below).

## Instructions

### Morrslieb Phase
This module allows to roll each night in a table to see in which phase is the random [Morrslieb](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Morrslieb). If the result is "Full Moon", it will automatically apply the Morrslieb filter.

## Dependencies
For Morrslieb Phase there is no dependencies, but there will be a nicer effect if you've installed the [FX Master](https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/fxmaster) module (like the button in the WFRP4e system).

Condition FX requires the modules [Token Magic FX](https://github.com/Feu-Secret/Tokenmagic) and [Automated Animations](https://github.com/otigon/automated-jb2a-animations).
