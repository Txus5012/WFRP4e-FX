# WFRP4e - Morrslieb Phase

A module for the [Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/wfrp4e) system for Foundrt VTT. This module allows to roll each night in a table to see in which phase is the random [Morrslieb](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Morrslieb). If the result is "Full Moon", it will automatically apply the Morrslieb filter.

## Instructions

The module consists in a table* an two macros. Import all of them to your world. After that, just use the Morrslieb Phase macro to roll on the table. If the result is "Full Moon", it will autom√°tically apply the Morrslieb filter.

To remove the filter use the Toggle Morrslieb macro. It's actually the same as pressing the Morrslieb button (so it can be used to turn it on too).

*I created two tables, one in English and one in Spanish. You only have to import the one in your prefered language. Even if you import both, the macro will roll in the table of the same language as your Foundry settings. It will roll in the English table if you use another language.
